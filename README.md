# TowardLanguageModellingForTheUkrainianLanguage
In this work, we are going to explore, extend, evaluate and compare different language models for the Ukrainian Language. The main objective is to offer an evaluation corpus and set a number of baselines.

## Abstract: 
Language Modelling (LM) is one of the most important subfields of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective of LM is to learn a probability distribution over sequences of linguistic units pertaining to a language. As it gives the probability of language unit that will follow, LM is actually a grammar of a language, and it
plays a key role in traditional NLP tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, grammatical error correction, natural language generation. Much work has been done for the English language in terms of developing both training and evaluation approaches. But there hasn’t been as much progress for the Ukrainian language. In this work, we are going to explore, extend, evaluate and compare different language models for the Ukrainian Language. The main objective is to offer an evaluation corpus and set a number of
baselines.
